        "Decorator are functions that change the behaviour of another function. We can say they extend the behaviour of a function, depending on what the decorator does. A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some functionality to it (often by wrapping it in another function), and returns the modified function. \\\\\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed around as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. \\\\\n",

        "2. **Timing**: Measuring and logging the time taken by functions to execute.\n",
        "3. **Access Control**: Checking user permissions before allowing access to certain functions (common in web applications).\n",
        "4. **Memoization/Caching**: Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.\n",
        "5. **Validation**: Checking input arguments before a function runs.\n",
        "6. **Resource Management**: Ensuring resources (like file handles, database connections) are properly managed (opened and closed) around a function's execution.\n",
        "7. **Pre/Post Processing**: Adding some operations before and/or after the main logic of a function.\n",

        "### When to Use a Decorator:\n",
        "Decorators are useful when you have a common piece of functionality that you want to apply across multiple functions without duplicating code. Instead of adding the same code to many functions, you can write it once in a decorator and apply it wherever needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Recursive functions** call themselves within their own definition. A recursive function typically has two parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the function stops calling itself (to avoid infinite loops).\n",
        "2. **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself with a modified argument, gradually reducing the problem size.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example: Factorial Using Recursion\n",
        "\n",

        "    - **Tree traversal** (e.g., searching through hierarchical data like file directories).\n",
